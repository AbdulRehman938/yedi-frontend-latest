                <div className='w-full h-[80%] flex flex-col justify-between items-start text-left'>
                    <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-[#55887C]'>Public restrooms used to terrify me</h1>
                    <p className='text-xl font-normal text-[#676666] leading-loose'>When someone once told us, “I avoid eating out unless I’m near a restroom,” we <br /> realized this wasn’t just inconvenience—it was anxiety. In fact, 44% of people feel <br /> anxious about using public restrooms, whether because of privacy concerns, <br /> cleanliness, or accessibility.</p>
                    <p className='text-xl font-normal text-[#676666] leading-loose'>These aren’t just small inconveniences—they disrupt everyday life. That’s why we <br /> built Yedi.</p>
                    <p className='text-xl font-normal text-[#676666] leading-loose'>We’ve all felt it — that awkward dance in a café, wondering if you should buy <br /> something just to ask for the code. That sinking feeling when you’re told, “Sorry, <br /> restrooms are for customers only.” Or worse, when there isn’t a restroom available at <br /> all.</p>
                    <p className='text-xl font-normal text-[#676666] leading-loose'>Yedi is a simple idea: make restroom access easy, respectful, and stress-free — for <br /> everyone. Using smart locks, QR codes, and a friendly app, we’re unlocking doors in <br /> cities across the country. No more gatekeeping. No more <br /> awkward requests. No more worrying if you’ll find a clean, accessible restroom when you need one.</p>
                    <p className='text-xl font-normal text-[#676666] leading-loose'>It’s about more than access. It’s about restoring peace of mind. It’s about helping <br /> people feel welcome wherever they are. It’s about transforming a daily pain point into <br /> something trustworthy and dignified.</p>
                    <p className='text-xl font-normal text-[#676666] leading-loose'>And it’s working — for guests, for businesses, for entire communities. Because <br /> everyone deserves to feel at home in public.</p>
